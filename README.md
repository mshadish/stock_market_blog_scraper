Stock Market Blog Scraper  
=========================
This project involves the scraping various financial blog sites  
(specifically, Insidermonkey and Kiplinger),  
crawling through each site and saving all of the opinion articles found.  
  
The idea is to build a body of documents representing market sentiment on any given day,  
with which we could run a time series analysis and determine whether or not market sentiment  
can serve as a medium- or long-term indicator of market performance.
